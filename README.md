# CataractAI üëÅÔ∏è

# Deployed Project: [Hugging Face: CataractAI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ranjeet-Potter/CataractAI-Cataract-Prediction-System)

CataractAI is a platform designed for medical staff and patients to facilitate the early detection of cataracts. The platform enables users to sign up, log in, and upload Fundus images. The uploaded images are analyzed using a deep learning model, EfficientNetB0, pre-trained on ImageNet, to determine whether cataracts are present or not.

## Features üìñ

- **User Roles**:

  **Patients**: Register, log in, and upload Fundus images for cataract detection.

  **Medical Staff**: Register with hospital details, log in, and manage Fundus image uploads.

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes the EfficientNetB0 model trained on ImageNet weights for high-accuracy predictions.
- **Secure Authentication**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: HTML templates render a clean and easy-to-navigate frontend.

## Tech Stack ü§ñ

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (EfficientNet-B0 model with ImageNet weights)
- **Frontend**: Basic HTML and CSS

## Installation üì¶

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        age INT,
        user_type ENUM('patient', 'staff'),
        hospital_name VARCHAR(255) );

**4. Run the application:**

        python app.py
